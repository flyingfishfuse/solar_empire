<p>Solar Empire is a web-based
space strategy game written in php. It can be run from any web browser with no
prior downloads. Since it comes with a GPL licence, the code is freely
available on the web. You are free to alter and change the code in any way you
wish, as long as you make those changes publicly available. This installation
guide was created to show users and developers how to set Solar Empire up on a
Windows based system to enable developing and testing of code. At present it
does not cover Linux/Unix based systems although the basic steps, apart from
those relating to setting up the webserver, are very similar. This guide was
written by Patrick Brady aka Maugrim The Reaper, and incorporates the advice
and suggestions of Moriarty. This guide is distributed with the Solar Empire
source code as an aid to developers and users who wish to test their own ideas
and additions on a working webserver on their home PCs.</p>

<p>If there are any additions you
would like to see added in the next version of this guide, please feel free to

<p><br>
In order to install Solar Empire on your Windows PC there are a number of files
you may need to download. Please check the list below and ensure that you have
the following available. The installation executables for each are available
free from the web.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>PHPTriad</b> - A Windows installer for an Apache/PHP/MySQL/Perl environment.
This download will automatically install a preconfigured Apache webserver in
C:\apache The latest edition incorporates the most recent stable versions of
MySQL, PHP, and Apache webserver. It also includes PhpMyAdmin for easier
management of your MySQL databases.<br>
<a href="http://www.phpgeek.com/">http://www.phpgeek.com/</a><br>
<br>
<b>ActivePerl</b> - Although the perl support with PHPTriad is adequate, it is
recommended that a more robust perl installation for Windows be used.
ActivePerl is freely available and comes fully documented with the added 'ppm'
program for installing modules (essential for later!)<br>
<a href="http://www.activestate.com/">http://www.activestate.com/</a><br>
<br>
<b>Windows Installer 2.0</b> - To enable proper installation of ActivePerl you
must install the Windows Installer 2.0 on your PC, version 1.1 may already be
installed but is now out of date.<br>
<br>
<b><i>MDAC 2.7</i></b><i> - Version 2.7+ of Microsoft's MDAC should also be
installed (MDAC 2.6 for Windows 95). If necessary, <b>DCOM95/98</b> may also be
required. Especially for Windows 95. These may not be required for Solar Empire
to operate successfully but are recommended to enable a full range of Perl
functions. If you intend on running only the perl scripts for SE, you can
probably ignore them.</i><br>
<br>
The above three may be downloaded from Microsoft Downloads. <b>Windows
Installer 2.0</b> is available from <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?ReleaseID=32831">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?ReleaseID=32831</a></p>

<p>I also recommend downloading <b>Win32Pad</b>
from <a href="http://www.gena0.com/">http://www.gena0.com/</a>. Many of the
Solar Empire files have been saved using a Unix format which makes them
difficult to read in Windows Notepad. This replacement for Notepad can read and
save in both Windows and Unix formats. It is an invaluable tool which you will
need for editing the files.<br>

How to install a Webserver on Win9x/Me<o:p></o:p></span></u></b></p>

<p><br>
Now to install your webserver! </p>

<p><i><span style='color:#999999'>&lt;Should
you wish to be adventurous and create your own custom-built webserver, please
see Appendix A: </span></i><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt;
color:#999999'>Installation of Apache Webserver from Separate Components. This
appendix contains step by step instruction on installing Apache, PHP, MySQL,
and ActivePerl separately and configuring each correctly. It is the most
interesting method and a great learning lesson. I recommend you try it at least
once just to get a feel for how each component fits together in the whole. It
is also useful if you wish to test various versions of the components besides
those available in PHPTriad.&gt;<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
18.0pt;color:#999999'>&lt;If you are faint-hearted and only wish to get this
part over and done with then&gt;</span></i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
18.0pt'> Below is laid out the instructions for installing PHPTriad, the
Apache/Php/MySQL/Perl enviroment. </span></p>

<p>It's a simple process. Locate
the PHPTriad installation file and run it. Apache Webserver, PHP, MySQL and
nsperl will each be installed and configured automatically in the C:\apache
directory. <br>
<br>
To test your installation, from the Start Menu&gt;Programs&gt;PHPTriad list
select &quot;Start MySQL&quot; and also &quot;Start Apache&quot;. MySQL will
run in the background. Apache will open an MS-DOS window which must remain open
for the duration of your Apache session. To stop your webserver, simply close
the Apache window.<br>
<br>
Start your favourite web-browser and type the following into the location bar
&quot;http://localhost/&quot;, press enter and the start up PHPTriad page
should now appear on screen. If it does not appear, consult the PHPTriad
documentation and website for a few insights as to what may have gone wrong. It
is usually nothing serious.<br>
<br>
Congradulations! You have just installed Apache Webserver and with
&quot;localhost&quot; being your default server name. <br>
<br>
Your final step is as follows: Open your C:\apache\php\php.ini file with a text
editor (win32pad/notepad)) and find the following &quot;extensions_dir&quot;.
Set this to your php extensions folder, &quot;c:\apache\php\extensions&quot;.
Next find below this a list of .dll files, typically named like php_zlib.dll
etc. Remove the semi-colon <b>;</b> from in front of the line
&quot;extension=php_gd.dll&quot;. This will allow php to load GD support on
start-up.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name=perl></a><b><u><span style='font-size:24.0pt;font-family:Helvetica'>3.
How to install and configure ActivePerl for Windows</span></u></b><br>
<br>
<br>
So what is wrong with the perl support with PHPTriad? nsperl is a bare bones
distribution, included in PHPTriad simply by popular choice and not fully
supported by the makers of PHPTriad. So first step, delete all contents of
C:\apache\Perl. Next ensure that the Windows Installer 2.0 is installed and run
your ActivePerl installation file. Set the installation path to, guess,
C:\apache\Perl\ and let it rip. The installation will take some minutes so do
not panic when it seems frozen on &quot;Creating HTML Documentation...&quot;,
that's normal and will pass after a while. Be patient!<br>
<br>
When the installation has halted, and you have restarted your PC, there a few
little things to finish up with. Perl and MySQL need to be available from
MS-DOS no matter which directory you are browsing. To accomplish this you must
add the following line to your Autoexec.bat file on your C:\ drive. From the
Start Menu select &quot;Run&quot; and type &quot;sysedit&quot;. Press enter and
your autoexec.bat file will be opened on top of your other sys files. Add the
line below to the bottom of all other text in autoexec.bat<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>PATH=%PATH%;c:\;c:\windows;c:\windows\command;c:\apache\perl\bin;c:\apache\mysql\bin;c:\apache\php</b><br>
<br>
If a similar line already exists simply add the apache entries to your Path.
Save the altered autoexec.bat file and restart your computer to let it take
effect. This will add the perl\bin and mysql\bin directories to your system path.
This means that in MS-DOS, you can run these commands from any directory you
may happen to be in.<br>
<br>
Now that ActivePerl is installed, we must add a number of modules to it in
order to allow perl scripts to interface with our MySQL databases.<br>
<br>
Start MS-DOS and type the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>ppm</b><br>
<br>
A new &quot;ppm&gt;&quot; prompt appears signalling that ActivePerl's
Programming Package Manager is running. Ensure that you are connected to the
internet. If you are using a proxy server in place of a direct connection
examine ActivePerl?s ppm documentation in relation to Proxies/Firewalls. Note
that we are not using ppm3, its still buggy and will not be able to install the
DBI or DBD::MySQL modules from the Activestate repository even though they are
listed as available. <br>
<br>
Type the following at the ppm prompt:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>install DBI</b><br>
<br>
Choose the yes &quot;Y&quot; option. DBI for perl will now be installed from
the internet. This will enable perl database support. When the install and
writing to package has finished (typically 1-2 mins) type the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>install DBD-MySQL</b><br>
<br>
Choose the yes &quot;Y&quot; option. DBD::MySQL will now be installed, adding
MySQL support to perl. Once the installation has completed you may exit ppm by
typing ?quit? at the ?ppm&gt;? prompt.<br>
<br>
ActivePerl is now installed, configured and ready for action.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name=unpack></a><b><u><span style='font-size:24.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:36.0pt;
font-family:Helvetica'>4. How to unpack and install the Solar Empire files</span></u></b><br>
<br>
<br>
Great! Your Apache webserver should now be working fine, so let us turn our
attention to other details. How do we get Solar Empire running on our
webserver?<br>
<br>
First unpack the SE zip file to a working directory. You should know that for
your web-browser to access files from your webserver, they must be placed in
the c:\apache\htdocs directory, this is equivalent to http://localhost/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For example the http://localhost/new.php file is stored on your PC at
C:\apache\htdocs\new.php and the Http://localhost/games/index.html file is
stored at C:\apache\htdocs\games\index.html<br>
<br>
With this in mind copy the contents of the zip file to your apache\htdocs
folder. This will also provide a c:\apache\htdocs\games folder which should
contain your perl scripts and Solar Empire game folders (which you will create
later!)<br>
<br>
Note that your htdocs directory already contains certain php and html files.
These are mostly test files for php, etc. The C:\apache\htdocs\phpmyadmin
folder contains your PHPMyAdmin installation for managing MySQL databases. More
on that in the next section.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name=mysql></a><b><u><span style='font-size:24.0pt;font-family:Helvetica'>5.
Creating the Solar Empire database</span></u></b><br>
<br>
<br>
Now the interesting bits! To run a Solar Empire game you must create a MySQL
database to hold and store the game information and variables. Open your web
browser and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ , first ensuring that you have
started MySQL and Apache from the start menu. Note that on the left-hand side
of the start page it lists the &quot;mysql&quot; and &quot;test&quot;
databases. Ignore these and in particular do not alter the &quot;mysql&quot;
database. <br>
<br>
Please note the following: By default your server is &quot;localhost&quot;,
your MySQL username does not exist, neither does your user password. You can
alter this, see the MySQL documentation on the website but at present whenever
asked for a MySQL username or password, leave both blank.<br>
<br>
Now! On the PHPMyAdmin page find the &quot;Create new database&quot; text box.
Enter the text &quot;solarempire&quot; and click the Create button. You will
now find yourself on the &quot;Database solarempire&quot; page. Excellent, you
have created your first Solar Empire database!!!<br>
<br>
Now locate the \games\new_se_games.sql file, e.g. C:\apache\htdocs\games\new_se_games.sql<br>
<br>
In your web browser, find the &quot;Location of the textfile:&quot; text box.
Paste in the location of the new_se_games.sql file. Make sure it is encased
with quotation marks, i.e. &quot;c:\apache\htdocs\games\new_se_games.sql&quot;.
Click the &quot;Go&quot; button. This will treat the contents of the file as an
SQL query, i.e. the same as making an entry in the ?Run SQL query/queries on
database? textbox.<br>
<br>
You will now get the &quot;Your SQL-query has been executed successfully&quot;
message. At the bottom of the page, five new tables will be listed. These will
contain some basic information about ship types, users, and each Solar Empire
game you create. Find the se_games table and click the &quot;browse&quot; link
beside it. This will open the table and display its contents. Which will, by
default, be non-existent. You must create a row and enter values.<br>
<br>
Return to the previous page and find the &quot;Run SQL query/queries on
database solarempire&quot; text box. You must enter a row into the se_games
table containing some basic information about the first game you will be
setting up. Copy the following text into the text box and click the
&quot;Go&quot; button.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>INSERT INTO se_games (game_id, name, db_name, admin_email, site_address,
status, admin_pw, description, num_stars, intro_message, paused, admin_name)
VALUES (1,'Original','segame','','',1,'passwd','',150,'',1,'Admin');</b><br>
<br>
This will insert a row into the se_games table containing the following
information:</p>

</table>

<p><br>
Most is self explanatory but note that the db_name value is &quot;segame&quot;.
&quot;segame&quot; will be used to name specific tables required for a single
game called &quot;Original&quot;. Wherever db_name is mentioned in this guide,
remember it stands for &quot;segame&quot;</p>

<p><i>You can if you wish, use
PHPMyAdmin?s ?Browse? and ?Edit? links to enter the extra data that is not
included in the query I gave you above for the se_games table. You can also use
the above MySQL query to create more games running on your server!</i><br>
<br>
This row defines information on our first Solar Empire game. Now we must set-up
our &quot;Original&quot; game's database tables. For this we must use another
.sql file, namely ?new.sql?.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name=config></a><b><u><span style='font-size:24.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:36.0pt;
font-family:Helvetica'>6. Preparing your game databases using new.sql and the
Perl files</span></u></b><br>
<br>
<br>
With the Solar Empire installation files, there came a number of perl .pl files
in the games folder. These files are used to perform tasks automatically in
MySQL. One example is build_universe.pl which when run will create the set of
star-systems, starports, random events, etc. that will define the game
universe. <br>
<br>
Open MS-DOS. Switch to the C:\apache\htdocs\games directory and type the
following command:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>perl
config.pl -build</b><br>
<br>
Press enter. The script will execute and ask you to fill in information
necessary for your Solar Empire configuration files.<br>
<br>
Your server should be &quot;localhost&quot;, database will be
&quot;solarempire&quot;, leave MySQL username and password blank unless you
have added them to MySQL. Game path will be
&quot;c:\apache\htdocs\games\&quot;. Url will be &quot;http://localhost/&quot;.
Sendmail will be &quot;0&quot; and query will be blank. A config.dat file
storing your entries will be created.<br>
<br>
When finished type the following command:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>perl
config.pl -compile</b><br>
<br>
Press enter. This will generate new configuration files based on your input,
i.e. config.dat.pl and config.dat.php<br>
These will later be used by the perl scripts when they execute and connect to
MySQL.</p>

<p>First we must create our game
databases, for example in our game where db_name is ?segame?, we need to create
a set of tables for that game and inaccessible by other games we may run at the
same time. To do this we create tables where the table name begins with
?segame_?, e.g. segame_bilkos, segame_ships, segame_users, etc.</p>

<p>The fist step is to open the
new.sql file in your games folder with Win32Pad. Now the tedious part, and this
is important! Replace every last ?GAMENAME?, even if part of another phrase,
with your db_name equivalent, i.e. ?segame?. Save your changes to
?temp_new.sql?, a temporary file which you may delete when finished. Close
Win32Pad and open PHPMyAdmin in your browser. In the textfile selection box,
type in the location of your new temp_new.sql and enclose it in quotation
marks, e.g. ?c:\apache\htdocs\games\temp_new.sql? Press the ?Go? button and let
the query run.</p>

<p>When it has finished running, bring
up the solarempire database page and browse the tables. You should now see a
list of new ?segame_*? tables in the database which each contain a number of
rows filled with information.<span style='font-size:24.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

24.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Helvetica'>7. Building the
Universe<o:p></o:p></span></u></b></p>

<p>Now it time to build our
universe! In your C:\apache\htdocs\games directory, create a new folder called
?segame?, or the db_name you are using. Next start up MS-DOS and switch to the
?games? directory. Type the following command:</p>

<p> </span><b>perl build_vars.pl db_name</b></p>

<p>where db_name is ?segame? or
what you originally used setting up the game?s row in the ?se_games? table.
This script will create in your new ?segame? folder a file named
?db_vars.inc.php?. Open it with a text editor and examine the variables
contained within. These are the variables which will be used when generating
the universe.</p>

<p>If you want to customize your
universe and exercise a little more control. Before running build_vars.pl, go
to the ?segame_db_vars? table in your solarempire database and edit the values
in each row to your liking. If you attempt, note the description of each value,
the min and also the max values. Save your changes and then run build_vars.pl
to create your db_vars.inc.php file.</p>

<p>Now generate the universe. In
MS-DOS, which in the games folder as before, type the following command:</p>

<p><span style='mso-tab-count:

<p>Press enter to run the script
and watch as it creates your universe and populates it with star systems,
starports, adds fuel and metal, and creates the links from star to star.
Remember that what you are seeing is a clever perl script using the contents of
the db_vars.inc.php file of your db_name folder to create a random yet
structured Universe for your game.</p>

<p>Once the universe is created,
it is time to log in as the Admin!</p>

<br>
<br>
Yeah! Now you finally get to log into your new game! Open your web brower and
go to http://localhost/<br>
<br>
If all went well you will find yourself at Solar Empire's default login screen.
Type in your login name &quot;Admin&quot; and password &quot;passwd&quot;. You
will be taken to the Game Listings page. Choose to join the Original game as
Admin. The next password is unique to the the Admin of Original. Admins of
different games should have different passwords once they pass the game listing
page. Anyway, the password is defaulted to &quot;passwd&quot; so type it in.<br>
<br>
Now you will get your first ship, as normal, and wind up in Star System 1, Sol.
You will also find that you have in the region of 1 Billion in cash, unlimited
turns, shields and fighters. You are the Admin after all, just don?t abuse your
power!<br>
<br>
Your first action should be the following. Check the page looks alright! You
will notice that the star map is missing. First check that the map is enabled
for viewing in user options. It will still be blank, why? Because you must now
perform the task of generating the map images in .png format so they can be
displayed on the star system page.<br>
<br>
Click on the ?Generate Maps? link beneath the blank universe map. This will
take you to a new page where a php script using the GD library (php_gd.dll)
will be executed. It can take a while generating the 151 maps required so be
patient. Once completed you will be automatically redirected back to the star
system page. <br>
<br>
Now, your universe map will be visible!<br>

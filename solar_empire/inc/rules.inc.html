<h2>Server Rules</h2>
<p>Breaking <b class=b1>any</b> one of these <i>Will</i> result in either being
banned from the game, retired from the game, or even deleted from the server!
So it's advised you read them carefully.</p>
<p>The game Admin's are the Final Judges of whether these rules have been broken.
Though the Server Admin has the very-final say (hey, it's our bandwidth).</p>
<ol>
	<li>Only <b class=b1>One</b> account per person. Under absolutely no
	circumstances may a player have more than one account. Multiple
	accounts will be deleted pro-actively without warning, and without
	the possibility of reprieve!</li>
	<li>You may <b>not</b> create an account for anyone other than yourself.</li>
	<li>Do <b>not</b> give your account password to anyone. Especially not to
	allow them to baby-sit your account (to do stuff for you).</li>
	Amoung other reasons, giving out your password can result in your account
	being stolen/abused. This if for <b>your</b> protection.</li>
	<li>Absolutely <b>No</b> Bug exploitation. If you find a bug, report it to
	the Admin. If something doesn't behave in the way you think it should.
	Report it.</li>
	<li>Do <b>not</b> log into any account other that the <b class=b1>one</b>
	that you created.</li>
	<li>Do <b>not</b> post harrasing, defamatory, racist etc, etc posts to any
	in-game forums or to users within the game.</li>
	<li>Do <b>not</b> post profanity (swear words, explicit material, etc, etc)
	to the in-game forums. The Admin decides what is classed as profanity. Not
	the user.</li>
	<li>Do not use a tool or program to access your account and play the game
	for you (otherwise known as a robot). Each account may only be used by
	one sentient being.</li>
	<li>Follow any specific in-game rules if there are any.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Above rules are subject to change without notice.</p>

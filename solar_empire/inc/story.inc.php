$story['The_Solar_Empire_Story'] = "In the year 2092, one hundred and twenty five years after man's momentus Apollo 11 mission to the moon, the four-member crew of the Starship Excelsior became the first the first humans to travel to another star system. The celebrations and excitement on Earth were intense, to say the least. Wild parties were thrown which taxed the resources of police departments around the world, the media was caught up in a frenzied coverage of the event, politicians praised their own efforts and Jonathon Browning, a nondescript technician at the sprawling SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute in Arizona received the first communication from an alien species.
<P>The United Nations was aghast at the message. Humanity shared a collective sense of rage and indignation. Far from the over-popularised demand of \"Take me to your leader\", the message was a polite but obviously threatening warning, advising mankind never to leave the Solar System again or risk war with a technologically advanced alien species. After months of heated debate and political manoeuvring, the reply was broadcast into deep space, a challenging request that the aliens mind their own business and steer clear of humanity's expansion into the galaxy. <P>The response of the aliens was swift and horribly brutal. A fleet of streamlined starships entered Earth's orbit a few weeks later and without provocation or a hint of warning, proceeded to pound into rubble the proud capital cities of the world powers. The resulting chaos plunged Earth into a new Dark Age.
<P>Economies stalled and crashed, countries descended into mayhem and war, famine was widespread and the situation was exacerbated by the accidental launch of a handful of nuclear missiles from various locations around the globe. Fighting against war, famine, long-forgotten diseases, radioactive hotspots and economic ruin, it took almost ten years for a new order to emerge, one ruled by the iron-fisted influence of the new age Corporations.
<P>Gradually order returned to the world under the control of the Corporations. But a fatal shortage of food and raw resources was the only stumbling block to their domination of the planet. Research into space travel was resurrected. In the New Age economies, private companies and entrepreneurs invested funds into the research and slowly a gradual process of integration and alliances gave birth to the first Clans, great organisations that encompassed Corporations, their allies and entire populations. The dawning of the first Warp Engine Drive, combining old Ion Propulsion Engines with experimental Wormhole technology, acted as a catalyst to speed up the development of spaceships capable of instantaneous interstellar travel.
<P>Earth's orbit became cluttered with dozens of orbiting Manufacturing Stations churning out advanced spacecraft to serve the needs of the Clans. Freighters, Battleships, Harvester ships for mining, Colony ships and single-pilot Fighters were built as well as a host of other exotic starships. Rivalry and competition resulted in spates of sabotage and industrial espionage as the Clans fought for supremacy of the new technologies that were being developed day by day.
<P>In 2123, the first interstellar starships left the Sol system and expanded the reach of the Clans to other star systems. These early exploratory missions were to act as the platform from which to launch an all out assault on the galaxy. Star Systems were mapped and explored for signs of fuel or metals, whether from meteorites or planets. Aliens were encountered but humanity's fleets of advanced spacecraft were able to repel many of the attacks. The alien species were many. New alliances and peace treaties were signed but the aggressiveness and savagery of other extraterrestrial species led to many attacks and raids.
<P>As mankind continued the expansion, rivalry and competition took a further step and fuelled wars and arguments between the Clans. Soon all out war was to ready erupt, Clans allied themselves with others and in time not even the Sol System was safe from attacks and raids by rival Clan members. <P>The year is now 2126. The Clans and individuals have agreed that this will be the year that humanity will at long last colonise the galaxy. A new age has dawned for mankind, an age of interstellar travel, Clan wars, extraterrestrial races and alien raids, an age of colonisation and exploration, an age of Solar Empires.

#delta bomb story
$story['Delta_Bomb_Blueprints_Disappear'] = "<br><b>27-Jan-2002</b><br><br>In breaking news today we have learnt of a new threat to the (in)stability of the galaxy. The Corporation known as <b class=b1>Heavy Weapons Inc.</b> has reported the theft of a set of blueprints for a new bomb they have been developing.
<p>Investigators believe the theft was conducted by a small militia group called <b class=b1>Liberation for Sol</b> for a third party, however they have no idea who the third party is at present. They fear that the new owners of the blueprints will use them to build the bombs, and then sell them via Bilkos to the highest bidder.
<p>The Bomb - which has the production name <b class=b1>Delta</b> - was developed for the military, with the specific purpose of being used to target large warfleets. Though Heavy Weapons Inc. refuse to discuss the capabilites of the bomb, they have released a statement saying it \"has the potential to cause major damage if it gets into the wrong hands.\"

$story['New_Ships_Spotted_at_Blackmarkets'] = "<br><b>5-June-2002</b><br><br>Those insidous hives of roguery and brigandage are now also home to two new ship designs.<br>At least thats what un-official reports from undercover officers who have infiltrated the pirate networks say. The reports, though patchy, allow an impression of the ships capabilities and purposes to be given.<br><br>The first goes by the production-name <b class=b1>Occultator</b>, and is reported to be the shell of an asteroid which has been filled with fighter bays. The reports neglect to state the purpose the ship was designed for, however from what has been uncovered, it seems likely the ship - if it can be called that - would be ideal for eliminating planets. The name given to the ship (Occultation meaning <b>The process of an asteroid blocking star-light from going to the planet below</b>) only strengthens this theory.
<p>The second ships is simply called <b class=b1>Gunboat</b>. All that is known of this ship is that it is small, fast, and outfitted with enough alien technology as to allow it to be a significant threat to merchant shipping.
<p>We only hope that by spreading the contents of these reports we are making fleet captains and planetary governours everywhere more aware of the new dangers that pervade the galaxy.

$story['Seatogus_announces_ship_improvements'] = "<br><b>5-June-2002</b><br><br>In related news, <b class=b1>Seatogu's Spacecraft Emporium</b> have made two important announcements today. The first of which stated they were to improve many existing ship designs by adding the recently developed turrets to them.<p>A spokesman for the company said that \"In this increasingly hostile galaxy, we want our customers to be able to feel safe. It is at their request that we have made these improvements, and we only hope that it serves to improve their life expectancy\".

<p>In a second, later announcement, Seatogu's proclaimed that all new ships will be outfitted with an improved battle AI (Artificial Intelligence).<br>This AI will allow ships to better utilise the numerous offensive and defensive upgrades that are available to ship captains these days. <br>Seatogu's press report says \"With the advent of this new AI we believe that pirates and brigands alike will have to be more wary as to what they attack\". The statement goes on to say \"This new AI will also allow captains to set their battleships to defend the rest of their fleet, as it features advanced <b>threat prediction algorithms</b> that enable battleships to spot incoming hostiles before they get to the fleet\".

<p>One industry critic made the astute observation that blackmarkets had somehow aquired this new AI software and were proceeding to install it on all their ships. She followed this through with a obvious, but controvesial point \"Blackmarket ships would be severly outmatched without this new software, and as such ship losses would be much lower on the side of Seatogu's customers\".
<br>The implication is clear. Seatogu's were unavailable for comment this evening.

<p>It should be noted that despite these improvements, the price of the ships will remain the same.
